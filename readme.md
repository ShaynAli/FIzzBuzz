# FizzBuzz

The classic FizzBuzz game in programmatic form.

Usage: `fizz_buzz.py [-h] [-s START] STOP`

```
positional arguments:
  STOP                  The number to end FizzBuzzing at (exclusive).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -s START, --start START
                        The number to start FizzBuzzing at (inclusive).
```

This is primarily for me to experiment with features in Python and set personal coding standards.
